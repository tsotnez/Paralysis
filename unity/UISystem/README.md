This is a modified version of the Unity-Technologies UI module which allows the use of multiple concurrent eventsystems in your project. 

### Update frequency and version updates? ###
The current commit (17th June 2017) applies to Unity version 5.6.1p4

Updates to this repository will most likely be done for each minor version of Unity.
It may take some weeks for this repository to get updated to a new Unity version as I'm not instantly switching to the newest versions.

### How do I get started? ###
+ A folder exists in the root directory called "Output", the generated dll's will output here in the correct folder structure
    * If you wish to use these dll's
    * Locate your Unity install location
    * Windows: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Data\UnityExtensions\Unity\GUISystem\{UNITY_VERSION}`
    * OSX: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Unity.app/Contents/UnityExtensions/Unity/GUISystem/{UNITY_VERSION}`
